# PotionsXme
This is an exercise for Potion's recruitment and a great opportunity for me to join their team.


## Language choice
I choosed to use Python for this exercise because it's one of the best languages for data manipulation. Moreover, Python is one of the languages wanted in Potion society.

## How does it work ?
1. The json data is extracted from file
2. Evaluating the result of the input :
	a. subdivide the rule to evaluate them recursively
	b. result is calculated through the return of the call PILE
3. Checking if the result correspond to expected output (available in json data)

## How to use ?
Set the file paths at beggining of the main.py file into the inputs_paths variable. Once done, the main.py can be launched with python.
